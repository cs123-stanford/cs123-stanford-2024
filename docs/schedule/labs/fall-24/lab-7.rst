Lab 6: Do What I Say (LLMs and Voice Control)
=============================================

*Goal: For this lab, you will explore with we can use LLMs and speech recognition to control Pupper to do a variety of tasks! Next you will benchmark this method against using a pre-trained CNN or Resnet architecture for speech recognition.*

Step 1. Clone the starter code into the Pupper
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash
  cd ~
  git clone https://github.com/cs123-stanford/pupper_llm_student.git ~/pupper_llm
